* Abstract

This is a [[https://github.com/n8han/giter8][giter8]] template for removing the boilerplate in setting up a new scala project:

- `main` and `test` source directories and stubs
- [[http://www.scalatest.org/][scalatest]]
- SBT simple confguration for `0.12.0`, scala `2.9.2`, and `scalatest` dependencies
- project `name`, `organization` and `version` customizable as variables
- everything in your project's base package imported automatically in repl sessions
